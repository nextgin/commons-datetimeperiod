# Date Time Period &mdash; `datetimeperiod`

This package helps you work with dates and times in a more flexible way. It lets you:

- Compare multiple time periods at once
- Find out when different time periods overlap
- Calculate the gaps between time periods
- Do basic comparisons between two time periods

`DateTimePeriod` objects are always immutable, ensuring that input dates remain unchanged and
operations does not cause side effects.

> This package is still a **work in progress**.
